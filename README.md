♫ I've got a mule and her name is Sal / 15 miles on the Erie Canal ♫

Before railroads, canals powered the early industrial revolution. Towed by horses, mules, or sometimes people, canalboats could carry up to 30 tons of cargo.

This work-in-progress canalboat set starts in 1700 and currently includes two British narrowboats:
- Narrowboat (carries all cargo except passengers and mail)
- Packet boat (carries passengers, mail, valuables, and express cargo)

In order to make early networks viable, the cost of building, clearing, and maintaining canals is reduced to 1/16 of default.
