# Sal's Canalboats

♫ I've got a mule and her name is Sal / 15 miles on the Erie Canal ♫

Before railroads, canals powered the early industrial revolution. Towed by horses, mules, or sometimes people, canalboats could carry up to 30 tons of cargo.

This work-in-progress canalboat set starts in 1700 and will include canalboats for both OpenTTD canals and Kruemelchen's WWAY roads.
