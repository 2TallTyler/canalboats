♫ I've got a mule and her name is Sal / 15 miles on the Erie Canal ♫

Before railroads, canals powered the early industrial revolution. Towed by horses, mules, or sometimes people, canalboats could carry up to 30 tons of cargo.

This work-in-progress canalboat set starts in 1700 and will include canalboats for both OpenTTD canals and Kruemelchen's WWAY roads.

In order to make early networks viable, the cost of building, clearing, and maintaining canals is reduced to 1/16 of default.
